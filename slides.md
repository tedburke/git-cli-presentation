# Git and the Command Line

## Contents

1. Command line interface (CLI) - tools, demo, philosophy
2. Git's command line interface - commands, workflow demo
3. The power of Vim - modes, motions, commands, shell integration
4. Pair programming with tmux (the terminal multiplexer)

## Command-line interface (CLI)

Although the term "CLI" applies more generally, I'm mostly talking about a shell (I use Bash) running in a terminal (I mostly use xfce4-terminal).

- Basic commands: cd, ls, cp, rm, pwd, etc.
- Text editors: vim, nano
- Useful utilities: wc, seq, column, sort
- Power tools: grep, awk, sed
- Development: gcc, gdb, python, git
- Other: pandoc, octave

## Philosophy
